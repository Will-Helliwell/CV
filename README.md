## William Helliwell

I have always been drawn to analytical thinking, and after 4 years of working within the food industry and travelling abroad, I am excited to have found software as a fulfilling career path that satisfies my desires to learn and problem-solve.

After graduating from Cambridge in 2016 with a degree in Natural Sciences, I worked as a Food Buyer for Sainsbury’s for over two years, applying analytical thinking in a fast-paced and high-pressure commercial context. Since leaving, I have created my own food website, spent eight months travelling and volunteering across South Asia and Taiwan, and started my own food business during lockdown.

More recently, I discovered my interest in coding, and chose to enrol at Makers Academy because of their strong focus on coding best practices, during which I have become passionate about writing well-structured, elegant code. I am now looking for a role where I can continue to build this skill, learn, and apply my new found knowledge to solve real-world difficult problems.

## Skills

Consider skills relevant to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Experience Since University

**Food Business** (May'20 to August'20)  

- When the pandemic put my chef job on-hold, I decided to take my food directly to customers by setting up a small business making and delivering rocky road in East Surrey. I was selling an average of 150 slices a week by the time I transitioned to full-time coding study.


**Travel and Food Website:** (Jun'19 to March'20)  

- Bought a one-way ticket and spent 8 months volunteering, working and travelling in South-East Asia, Taiwan and Sri Lanka. Taught myself to use Wordpress in my spare time and created a website for ‘amateur food enthusiasts’, which is now an ongoing outlet for my love of food.

**Sainsbury's** (May'17 to Jun'19)  
_Food Buyer, Cafe_

- After 11 months learning in an entry-level role in the trading team, I was promoted to food buyer for the cafe, where I was responsible for circa £60m annual spend in conjunction with the Trading Manager.
- Analysed data from Sainsbury’s trading systems, combining insights with store-visits, supplier visits and internal product development meetings to design the overall customer proposition (focussing particularly on product range/menu). Created the pricing and promotions structure for this range. Responsible for supplier strategy and negotiations on a wide range of product areas including but not limited to: ready meals, soft drinks, bakery, impulse and ice cream.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (Oct'12 to March'12)

- I chose to enrol at Makers Academy to accelerate my learning because they were highly selective, had a strong reputation for producing quality graduates, and a focus on best practices. The course has given me a solid grounding in:
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### Harvard CS50 (August 20 to present)

- I am enjoying taking this course in my spare time to give me a more rounded view of software development, learning about the fundamentals of Computer Science, and gaining a better understanding of how source code works ‘under the hood’ through C-based coding challenges.
- Nb - I can’t share the source code publicly due to academic honesty rules, but  am happy to share on request.

#### University of Cambridge (2013 to 2016)

- Graduated with a 2:1 in Biological Natural Sciences, specialising in developmental biology.
- Following critical analysis of the literature, I collaborated with my supervisor to design a series of experiments, and independently produced a 7000 word report providing the first evidence for the existence of a specific signaling system in C.elegans (a nematode worm).
- Successfully balanced a full 7-day-week academic timetable with multiple voluntary commitments (e.g. secretary of the rugby club – responsible for club finances, preparations for teaching Summer camps in China).

#### RGS Guildford (2005 to 2012)

- A2 - Biology, Chemistry and Maths, all A* (98% UMS). Won the Robins prize for top performance in Biology for my school.
- AS - Biology, Chemistry, Maths, Physics, all A (99% UMS)
- GCSE - 9, all A*
- CREST Award - won a British Science Association Gold Award for a voluntary Summer project studying developmental neurobiology in the zebrafish at King’s College London.

## Hobbies

- Food - food has always been an obsession for me. Even before starting my recipe site, I cooked all the time, brewed my own beer and even built my own pizza oven from scratch (which, to my own and everyone else’s amazement, actually works!).
- Sport - lifelong rugby fanatic (now retired from the real-deal, but a regular at the local touch rugby club) and now a new but enthusiastic climber (stuck on 6B, for now…).
- Travel - I love travelling (mostly to learn about history and food) and have spent nearly two years of my life travelling, teaching, working and volunteering around South-East Asia, South Asia, China and Taiwan.
- Guitar
