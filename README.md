## William Helliwell

I have always been drawn to analytical thinking, and after 4 years of working within the food industry and travelling abroad, I am excited to have found software as a fulfilling career path that satisfies my desires to learn and problem-solve.

After graduating from Cambridge in 2016 with a degree in Natural Sciences, I worked as a Food Buyer at Sainsbury’s for over two years, applying analytical thinking in a fast-paced and high-pressure commercial context. Since leaving, I have created [my own food website](https://makethatdish.com/), spent eight months travelling and volunteering across South Asia and Taiwan, and started my own food business during lockdown in the UK.

More recently, I discovered my interest in coding, and chose to enrol at Makers Academy because of their strong focus on coding best practices. During the course I have become passionate about writing clean, reusable code. I am now looking for a role where I can continue to build this skill and apply my new found knowledge to solve real-world difficult problems.


## Projects


| Name                         | Description       | Tech/tools        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| [**Recipy**](https://github.com/Will-Helliwell/Recipy) | • A recipe app with infinite scroll, and  live-filtering of recipes. I paired with a teammate to build an ambitious web scraper, learning Puppeteer to extract 5000 recipes from bbcgoodfood.com. <br> • Improved team process - proposed and conducted daily knowledge sharing and feedback sessions, helping the team to collaborate and learn the new stack from each other. Deployed working software in small batches, completing almost all user-stories from an ambitious list in 2 weeks. | Node.js, React, Mongo DB, Puppeteer, Cypress|
| [**Whisky Tracker**](https://github.com/Will-Helliwell/whisky_tracker) | • My current ongoing side project - will save whisky-lovers’ time by tracking their favourite bottles across multiple sites using a web-scraper, emailing them when their desired price is reached. <br>• Following a tight BDD process to build from user-stories, using an MVC architecture. Current status: testing infrastructure, Travis continuous integration and user sign-in/up/out completed.| Rails, PostgreSQL, React |
| [**Essbok**](https://github.com/Will-Helliwell/essbok) | • A social media app developed as a team. Allows signed-in users to make and delete posts from a posts page (a single-page React app  that can dynamically change in an event-based manner).<br>• Used ActiveRecord and PostgreSQL to manage user and post data in a SQL database. <br>• Unit and integration tested. Deployed via a continuous integration/continuous delivery pipeline. | Rails, PostgreSQL, React |
| [**Bank Tech Test**](https://github.com/Will-Helliwell/bank_tech_test) | • A bank app solo project built in Ruby that can be interacted with via any Ruby REPL <br>• An example of a fully test-driven application built to a set of user stories following OO principles.<br>• 100% test coverage, 100% test-isolation using mocking. | Ruby, Rspec |




## Skills

- **Problem-solving & Creativity** - I loved thinking analytically from an early age, volunteering to spend a Summer at 16 working in a Developmental Neurobiology lab at King's College London, earning me  a CREST Gold Award . This has continued into my career. As buyer at Sainsbury's Cafe, I organised a trial to drastically reduce menu-size in 10 cafes. Following its success, I then began my own plan to roll-out menu reduction in a targeted manner across the estate by data-lead clustering of the 325 cafes for the first time.
- **Learning mindset** - able to quickly learn what I need to know in order to get the job done. I joined Sainsbury's following an incumbent departure. Quickly familiarised myself with all technical aspects (including till-setup, menu board proofing & ordering, price and promotions setup, food photography) to deliver the first range change with no major hiccups. Have a strong personal appetite to learn - taught myself how to use Wordpress and host a website with no prior knowledge during my spare time abroad.
- **People Skills** - worked for 2 years as part of a close-knit Agile trading team at Sainsbury's. Communicated with technical, product developers, supply chain etc in order to deliver large projects, including the largest range review Cafe had seen for 20 years. As buyer, I built professional relationships with suppliers, deciding when to collaborate and when to 'push'.
- **Project Management and Initiative** - experience managing and delivering complex projects involving collaboration with external teams and stakeholders, e.g. improving the Sainsbury's cafe salad range to increase sales by over 20%. Have the initiative to drive these projects myself even if it requires learning as I go - when I started my cakes business, I had to organise and familiarise myself with all aspects, including but not limited to: marketing, order management, efficient cooking on a commercial scale, business registration and government food safety requirements.

## Experience

**Food Website and Business** (Jun'19 to Sep'20)  

- Taught myself to build a [Wordpress website](https://makethatdish.com/) from scratch to share knowledge with amateur cooks whilst abroad. I now write for and maintain the site, attracting 1000 unique visitors per month.<br>
- Returned to the UK and started my own business selling fridge-cake in East Surrey. Learned aspects of marketing, product development, packaging, delivery and food safety to deliver up to 160 slices/week.

**Sainsbury's** (May'17 to Jun'19)  
_Food Buyer, Cafe_

- Promoted after 11 months to Cafe Buyer, where I owned the design and execution of trading strategy (responsible for 350 stores and a £60m annual spend). Made data-driven decisions to keep margin flat.<br>
- Developed strong communication skills working in an Agile team and building supplier relationships.<br>
- Problem-solving and communication -  designed a salad range to improve customer experience. Listened to the perspective of Operations, who were cautious about difficulty for colleagues. Adapted to find a pragmatic solution, reducing menu complexity elsewhere to launch (sales increased 20% YoY).

## Education

- Relational (PostgreSQL) and non-relational (MongoDB) databases.
- RSpec, Jasmine


#### Harvard CS50 (August 20 to present)

- I am enjoying taking this course in my spare time to give me a more rounded view of software development. Specifically I am learning about the fundamentals of Computer Science and gaining a better understanding of how source code works ‘under the hood’ through C-based coding challenges.<br>
- Nb - I can’t share my source code publicly due to academic honesty rules, but  am happy to share on request.

#### University of Cambridge (2013 to 2016)

- 2.1 in  Natural Sciences at Christ’s College, specialising in Developmental Biology and Cancer.<br>
-  Used close attention to detail and data analysis to provide the first evidence for a specific signalling pathway in the nematode worm C.elegans. Clearly communicated the findings to a scientific panel.

#### RGS Guildford (2005 to 2012)

- A2 - Biology, Chemistry and Maths, all A* (98% UMS). Won the Robins prize for top performance in Biology for my school.
- AS - Biology, Chemistry, Maths, Physics, all A (99% UMS)
- GCSE - 9, all A*
- CREST Award - won a British Science Association Gold Award for a voluntary Summer project studying Developmental Neurobiology in the zebrafish at King’s College London.

## Other Interests

- **Food** - food has always been an obsession for me. Even before starting my recipe site, I cooked all the time, brewed my own beer and even built my own pizza oven from scratch (which, to my own and everyone else’s amazement, actually works!).
- **Sport** - lifelong rugby fanatic (now retired from the real-deal, but a regular at the local touch rugby club) and now a new but enthusiastic climber (stuck on 6B, for now…).
- **Travel** - I love travelling (mostly to learn about history and food) and have spent nearly two years of my life travelling, teaching, working and volunteering around South-East Asia, South Asia, China and Taiwan.
- **Guitar**
