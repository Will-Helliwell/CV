I am a full-stack developer with a Cambridge STEM background looking to learn and grow my skills by contributing to difficult problems in a new domain.

Throughout my working life I haven’t been afraid to challenge myself in order to learn and pursue a fulfilling career. In 2019, I Ieft my successful job as Food Buyer at Sainsbury’s because I knew I wanted a more active problem-solving role solving. Since then, I have worked and travelled across 6 countries, learned Wordpress to create a [website](https://makethatdish.com/) that now attracts 1000 users a month, and started my own lockdown food business. In November I used my savings to enroll in Makers Academy because I found software to be the field that marries my analytical strengths with my desire to build things that solve problems for people (with the refreshing bonus of being stimulating day-to-day!).

During my time at Makers Academy I have become passionate about writing clean, well-tested code. I am now looking for a role where I can continue to build this skill and apply my new found knowledge to solve real-world difficult problems.



## Projects


| Name                         | Description       | Tech/tools        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| [**Recipy**](https://github.com/Will-Helliwell/Recipy) | • A recipe app with infinite scroll, and  live-filtering of recipes. I paired with a teammate to build an ambitious web scraper, learning Puppeteer to extract 5000 recipes from bbcgoodfood.com. <br> • Improved team process - proposed and conducted daily knowledge sharing and feedback sessions, helping the team to collaborate and learn the new stack from each other. Deployed working software in small batches, completing almost all user-stories from an ambitious list in 2 weeks. | Node.js, React, Mongo DB, Puppeteer, Cypress|
| [**Whisky Tracker**](https://github.com/Will-Helliwell/whisky_tracker) | • My current ongoing side project - will save whisky-lovers’ time by tracking their favourite bottles across multiple sites using a web-scraper, emailing them when their desired price is reached. <br>• Following a tight BDD process to build from user-stories, using an MVC architecture. Current status: testing infrastructure, Travis continuous integration and user sign-in/up/out completed.| Rails, PostgreSQL, React |
| [**Essbok**](https://github.com/Will-Helliwell/essbok) | • A social media app developed as a team. Allows signed-in users to make and delete posts from a posts page (a single-page React app  that can dynamically change in an event-based manner).<br>• Used ActiveRecord and PostgreSQL to manage user and post data in a SQL database. <br>• Unit and integration tested. Deployed via a continuous integration/continuous delivery pipeline. | Rails, PostgreSQL, React |
| [**Bank Tech Test**](https://github.com/Will-Helliwell/bank_tech_test) | • A bank app solo project built in Ruby that can be interacted with via any Ruby REPL <br>• An example of a fully test-driven application built to a set of user stories following OO principles.<br>• 100% test coverage, 100% test-isolation using mocking. | Ruby, Rspec |




## Skills

I...

- **Am a quick learner and problem-solver** - I have always loved learning about complex new domains and am not afraid to quickly apply learnings to solve problems, seeking support where necessary. At Sainsbury’s, not only did I successfully manage the technical implementation (e.g. merchandising and till system set-up) of a cafe range review 3 months into my first role with no handover, but after only 6 months I spotted an opportunity for better cafe menu board sourcing. Even though we had been with the supplier for 25 years, I decided to lead a menu-board tender after seeking guidance from my trading manager. The tender saved the category £300k per year and I was promoted to Cafe buyer after 11 months. In a software context, I used my new React and MongoDB skills to suggest and implement a back-end mechanism when my group was struggling with live-filtering on the front-end. This allowed us to keep cleaner front-end logic and complete the feature within the 2-week timeframe.

- **Know when it's best to work as a team** - throughout my career I have enjoyed collaborating with others to get things done. For example, as Sainsbury’s Cafe Buyer I created an ambitious plan to halve menu size across the estate in order to improve customer service. When this was rejected on the basis of commercial-risk, I adapted by collaborating closely with Operations and Technical teams to set-up a low-risk trial in 10 stores. After analyzing 5% sales uplift (extrapolating to a possible £8m extra turnover across the estate), I presented the results in a deck that successfully gained senior management’s approval.

- **Am experienced in Agile ways of working** - I have over two years of experience working within a Scrum framework at Sainsbury’s, participating in and subsequently leading sandups and even presenting to the whole trading floor. I liked the way in which the Agile methodology promoted knowledge-sharing and debates over approaches, and this mindset has continued with me into tech. For example, during our final project at Makers I helped my team to learn the brand new MERN stack by running daily knowledge-sharing sessions. This enabled us to develop more efficiently and focus on the product, eventually finishing all but one of our features from an ambitious list in 2 weeks.

- **Understand the balance between perseverance and support** - I'm pretty relentless once I get my teeth into something, especially if it's a big project or a new learning (e.g. learning brickwork and ordering half a ton of clay to build a working wood-fired pizza oven), and I feel this trait translates pretty well into one of coders' favourite past-times: debugging (I've already come through some hair-pulling problems setting up the infrastructure for my [whisky tracker project](https://github.com/Will-Helliwell/whisky_tracker)). At the same time however, I understand that support can make the learning process much more efficient. At Sainsbury's for example, I asked an experienced buyer from another area to act as my informal mentor, which helped me to progress to Buyer myself within 11 months. I was then able to pass this favour on by acting as a mentor to 3 category assistants myself.


## Experience

**Food Website and Business** (Jun'19 to Sep'20)  

- Taught myself to build a [Wordpress website](https://makethatdish.com/) from scratch to share knowledge with amateur cooks whilst abroad. I now write for and maintain the site, attracting 1000 unique visitors per month.<br>
- Returned to the UK and started my own business selling fridge-cake in East Surrey. Learned aspects of marketing, product development, packaging, delivery and food safety to deliver up to 160 slices/week.

**Sainsbury's** (May'17 to Jun'19)  
_Food Buyer, Cafe_

- Promoted after 11 months to Cafe Buyer, where I owned the design and execution of trading strategy (responsible for 350 stores and a £60m annual spend). Made data-driven decisions to keep margin flat.<br>
- Developed strong communication skills working in an Agile team and building supplier relationships.<br>
- Problem-solving and communication -  designed a salad range to improve customer experience. Listened to the perspective of Operations, who were cautious about difficulty for colleagues. Adapted to find a pragmatic solution, reducing menu complexity elsewhere to launch (sales increased 20% YoY).

## Other Interests

- **Teaching/Mentoring** - I am currently a volunteer coach at Codebar, coaching programming basics to minority students. I have always got a buzz from helping other people and have sought out opportunities to do so: twice I have volunteered to travel to China to teach schoolchildren and once as a residential advisor at a Summer camp in Oxford. I have also acted as mentor at Makers Academy and Sainsbury's. 
- **Learning** - perhaps my biggest driver, which has manifested itself in many forms and hobbies: reading non-fiction, starting my food business, spending a Summer at 16 researching neurobiology at KCL, building a wood-fired oven, building my food website). For me, tech and programming is an exciting and almost limitless opportunity to keep this going. 
- **Food** - if I hadn’t mentioned already. Along with the website and pizza oven, I'm always cooking, preserving, brewing and most importantly of all, eating.
- **Sport** - lifelong rugby fan (now retired from the real-deal, but a regular at the local touch rugby club) and now a new but enthusiastic climber (stuck on 6B, for now…).
- **Travel** - I love travelling (mostly to learn about history and food) and have spent nearly two years of my life travelling, teaching, working and volunteering around South-East Asia, South Asia, China and Taiwan.
