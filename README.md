## William Helliwell

I have always been drawn to analytical thinking, and after 4 years of working within the food industry and travelling abroad, I am excited to have found software as a fulfilling career path that satisfies my desires to learn and problem-solve.

After graduating from Cambridge in 2016 with a degree in Natural Sciences, I worked as a Food Buyer at Sainsbury’s for over two years, applying analytical thinking in a fast-paced and high-pressure commercial context. Since leaving, I have created [my own food website](https://makethatdish.com/), spent eight months travelling and volunteering across South Asia and Taiwan, and started my own food business during lockdown in the UK.

More recently, I discovered my interest in coding, and chose to enrol at Makers Academy because of their strong focus on coding best practices. During the course I have become passionate about writing clean, reusable code. I am now looking for a role where I can continue to build this skill and apply my new found knowledge to solve real-world difficult problems.

## Skills

- **Problem-solving & Creativity** - I loved thinking analytically from an early age, volunteering to spend a Summer at 16 working in a Developmental Neurobiology lab at King's College London, earning me  a CREST Gold Award . This has continued into my career. As buyer at Sainsbury's Cafe, I organised a trial to drastically reduce menu-size in 10 cafes. Following its success, I then began my own plan to roll-out menu reduction in a targeted manner across the estate by data-lead clustering of the 325 cafes for the first time.
- **Learning mindset** - able to quickly learn what I need to know in order to get the job done. I joined Sainsbury's following an incumbent departure. Quickly familiarised myself with all technical aspects (including till-setup, menu board proofing & ordering, price and promotions setup, food photography) to deliver the first range change with no major hiccups. Have a strong personal appetite to learn - taught myself how to use Wordpress and host a website with no prior knowledge during my spare time abroad.
- **People Skills** - worked for 2 years as part of a close-knit Agile trading team at Sainsbury's. Communicated with technical, product developers, supply chain etc in order to deliver large projects, including the largest range review Cafe had seen for 20 years. As buyer, I built professional relationships with suppliers, deciding when to collaborate and when to 'push'.
- **Project Management and Initiative** - experience managing and delivering complex projects involving collaboration with external teams and stakeholders, e.g. improving the Sainsbury's cafe salad range to increase sales by over 20%. Have the initiative to drive these projects myself even if it requires learning as I go - when I started my cakes business, I had to organise and familiarise myself with all aspects, including but not limited to: marketing, order management, efficient cooking on a commercial scale, business registration and government food safety requirements.

## Experience

**Food Business** (May'20 to August'20)  

- When the pandemic put my chef job on-hold, I decided to take my food directly to customers by setting up a small business making and delivering rocky road in East Surrey. I was selling an average of 150 slices a week by the time I transitioned to full-time coding study.


**Travel and Food Website:** (Jun'19 to March'20)  

- Bought a one-way ticket and spent 8 months volunteering, working and travelling in South-East Asia, Taiwan and Sri Lanka. Taught myself to use Wordpress in my spare time and [created a website](https://makethatdish.com/) for ‘amateur food enthusiasts’, which is now an ongoing outlet for my love of food.

**Sainsbury's** (May'17 to Jun'19)  
_Food Buyer, Cafe_

- After 11 months learning in an entry-level role in the trading team, I was promoted to Food Buyer for the cafe, where I was responsible for circa £60m annual spend in conjunction with the Trading Manager.
- Analysed data from Sainsbury’s trading systems, combining insights with store-visits, supplier visits and internal product development meetings to design the overall customer proposition (focussing particularly on product range/menu). Created the pricing and promotions structure for this range. Responsible for supplier strategy and negotiations on a wide range of product areas including but not limited to: ready meals, soft drinks, bakery, impulse and ice cream.
- Worked for two years as part of a close-knit trading team for cafe, following the Agile Methodology.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (Oct'12 to March'12)

- I chose to enrol at Makers Academy to accelerate my learning because they were highly selective, had a strong reputation for producing quality graduates, and focussed on coding best practices. The course has given me a solid grounding in:
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### Harvard CS50 (August 20 to present)

- I am enjoying taking this course in my spare time to give me a more rounded view of software development. Specifically I am learning about the fundamentals of Computer Science and gaining a better understanding of how source code works ‘under the hood’ through C-based coding challenges.
- Nb - I can’t share my source code publicly due to academic honesty rules, but  am happy to share on request.

#### University of Cambridge (2013 to 2016)

- Graduated with a 2:1 in Biological Natural Sciences, specialising in Developmental Biology.
- Following critical analysis of the literature, I collaborated with my supervisor to design a series of experiments, and independently produced a 7000 word report providing the first evidence for the existence of a specific signalling system in *C.elegans* (a nematode worm).
- Successfully balanced a full 7-day-week academic timetable with multiple voluntary commitments (e.g. secretary of the rugby club – responsible for club finances, preparations for teaching Summer camps in China).

#### RGS Guildford (2005 to 2012)

- A2 - Biology, Chemistry and Maths, all A* (98% UMS). Won the Robins prize for top performance in Biology for my school.
- AS - Biology, Chemistry, Maths, Physics, all A (99% UMS)
- GCSE - 9, all A*
- CREST Award - won a British Science Association Gold Award for a voluntary Summer project studying Developmental Neurobiology in the zebrafish at King’s College London.

## Other Interests

- **Food** - food has always been an obsession for me. Even before starting my recipe site, I cooked all the time, brewed my own beer and even built my own pizza oven from scratch (which, to my own and everyone else’s amazement, actually works!).
- **Sport** - lifelong rugby fanatic (now retired from the real-deal, but a regular at the local touch rugby club) and now a new but enthusiastic climber (stuck on 6B, for now…).
- **Travel** - I love travelling (mostly to learn about history and food) and have spent nearly two years of my life travelling, teaching, working and volunteering around South-East Asia, South Asia, China and Taiwan.
- **Guitar**
