## William Helliwell

After 4 years within the food industry and abroad, I am excited to have found software as fulfilling career that marries my analytical strengths with genuine interest and a desire to learn.

Having graduated from Cambridge in 2016 with a 2:1 in Natural Sciences, I have always been driven, inquisitive and naturally drawn to logical thinking and problem-solving. This continued into my career, where I spent over 2 years on the trading team at Sainsbury’s, applying such thinking in a fast-paced and high-pressure commercial context. After further exploring the food and hospitality industries by working and volunteering abroad, starting my own website, and starting my own food business, I have at last found coding as a discipline that I am driven to pursue long-term.

Makers Academy has given me a solid foundation in software development best practice, and I am now genuinely excited to apply all of my new-found knowledge and passion for coding to solve difficult problems and build useful things, continuing to learn wherever possible.

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

#### Makers Academy (Oct'12 to March'12)

I picked Makers Academy to speed up my learning process, and give me a thorough grounding in best coding practices, including but not limited to:
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### Harvard CS50 (August 20 to present)

- I am enjoying taking this course in my spare to learn more about the fundamentals of computer Science, and gain a better understanding of how source code works ‘under the hood’ through coding challenges in C.

#### University of Cambridge (2013 to 2016)

- Graduated with a 2:1 in Biological Natural Sciences, specialising in developmental biology

#### RGS Guildford (2005 to 2012)

- A2 - Biology, Chemistry and Maths, all A* (98% UMS). Won the Robins prize for top performance in Biology for my school.
- AS - Biology, Chemistry, Maths, Physics, all A (99% UMS)
- GCSE - 9, all A*
- CREST Award - gifted a Gold Award by the British Science Association for a voluntary Summer project studying developmental neurobiology in the zebrafish at King’s College London.

## Other Experience

**Lockdown Cakes Business** (May'20 to August'20)  

- When the pandemic put my chef job on-hold, I decided to take my food directly to customers by setting up a small business making and delivering rocky road in East Surrey. I was selling an average of 150 slices a week by the time I transitioned to full-time coding study.


**Travel and Food Website:** (Jun'19 to March'20)  

- Bought a one-way ticket and spent 8 months volunteering, working and travelling in South-East Asia, Taiwan and Sri Lanka. Taught myself how to use Wordpress in my spare time and created a website for ‘amateur food enthusiasts’ (like me!), which is now an ongoing outlet for my love of food.

**Sainsbury's** (May'17 to Jun'19)  
_Food Buyer, Cafe_

- After 11 months in an entry-level role in the cafe trading team, I was promoted to food buyer for the cafe, where I was responsible for circa £60m annual spend in conjunction with the Trading Manager.
- Analysed data from Sainsbury’s trading systems, and combined insights with store-visits, supplier visits and internal product development meetings to design the overall customer proposition (focussing particularly on product range/menu). Created the pricing and promotions structure. Responsible for negotiating costs with suppliers on a wide range of product areas including but not limited to: ready meals, soft drinks, bakery, impulse and ice cream.
